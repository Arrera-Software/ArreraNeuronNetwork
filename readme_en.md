This project aims to create a foundation for developing personal assistants using Python 3.13 exclusively.

## Features

The Arrera Neuron Network assistant is equipped with several specialized neurons to handle various requests:

*   **Weather**: Provides current weather, tomorrow morning's, or tomorrow afternoon's forecast (home, work, or current location).
*   **Temperature**: Gives the current temperature.
*   **Brief (Breef)**: Provides a summary of news, weather, and tasks (morning brief or on-demand summary).
*   **GPS**: Gives current geographical coordinates and can launch a Google Maps route (start and end points).
*   **News**: Delivers the latest news.
*   **Translation**: Opens the translation tool.
*   **Software Opening**: Opens user-configured software or system applications (calculator).
*   **Website Opening**: Opens saved websites or predefined sites (YouTube, YouTube Music).
*   **Radio**: Plays radio stations (Europe 1, France Info, NRJ, Skyrock, etc.) or stops the radio.
*   **Interface Modes**: Activates specific interface modes via socket commands.
*   **Arrera Tools**: Opens internal tools like the YouTube downloader or calculator modes (complex, Pythagoras).
*   **Time and Date**: Gives the current time and date.
*   **Time Tools**: Launches the stopwatch, clock, or timer.
*   **Agenda**: Opens the agenda, allows adding or removing events.
*   **Tasks**: Manages the to-do list (add, remove, mark as done, check task count).
*   **Simple Search**: Performs a standard search on the default search engine.
*   **Big Search**: Performs a more in-depth search (depending on the `bigRecherche` implementation).
*   **Calculations**: Performs simple mathematical calculations.
*   **Reading**: Starts content reading.
*   **Documentation**: Opens the assistant's documentation.
*   **Spelling**: Opens the spelling correction tool.
*   **Projects**: Create, open, close, and list projects. Manage files within projects.
*   **Spreadsheet**: Open, close, read, and modify Excel files (add values, calculate sum, average, min, max).
*   **Word Processing**: Open, close, read, and write to Word files.
*   **GUI Work**: Opens graphical interfaces dedicated to project management, spreadsheets, and Word files.
*   **Documentation Search**: Search within development documentation, Microsoft, Python, or GitHub.
*   **Development Tools**: Opens tools like the variable organizer, color selector, or GitHub management.
*   **Window Management**: Opens task, agenda, or summary (brief) windows.
*   **Display Modes**: Activates different display modes (mode 1 to 6).
*   **Shutdown**: Manages the shutdown of the assistant or modes.

Arrera Neuron Network also features AI model integration within the Chatbot Neuron.
